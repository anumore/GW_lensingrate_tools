# GW_lensingrate_tools
This code will help you 
- to calculate lensing rates for galaxies and clusters (assuming SIS lens density profile) for varied merger rate density models
- to constrain the merger rate density models given the detection of N lensed events
- to calculate time delay distribution assuming the lens density profile is SIS
